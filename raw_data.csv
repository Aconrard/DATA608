"Notes"
"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Office of the Actuary produces Health Expenditures by State of Residence and Health Expenditures by State of Provider every five years. The State Health Expenditure Accounts are a subcomponent of the National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA), the official government estimates of health spending in the United States.  "
""
"All health spending is displayed in millions of dollars."
""
"Health Care Expenditures measure spending for all privately and publicly funded personal health care services and products (hospital care, physician services, nursing home care, prescription drugs, etc.) by state of provider. Hospital spending is included and reflects the total net revenue (gross charges less contractual adjustments, bad debts, and charity care). Costs such as insurance program administration, research, and construction expenses are not included in this total."
